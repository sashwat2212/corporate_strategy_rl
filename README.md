# <div align="center"> Corporate Strategy RL</div>

##  Project Overview
This project implements an **agentic AI system** for **strategic corporate planning** using reinforcement learning (**Q-learning**).  
The system simulates business decisions in a **competitive market**, including:

 **Investment Strategies**  
 **Marketing Campaigns**  
 **Pricing Adjustments**  
 **Acquisitions and Mergers**  

> *The simulation evaluates agents based on total rewards, financial capital, and market share dynamics.*

##  Architecture

###  1. Environment (`env.py`)
-  Defines the **corporate marketplace** with dynamic competition.
-  Implements a **reward structure** based on revenue, capital growth, and market expansion.
-  Tracks key **KPIs**: Total rewards, capital, and market share.

###  2. Agents (`agents.py`)
-  Uses **Q-learning** for strategic decision-making.
-  Implements **exploration-exploitation** balance.
-  Tracks **efficiency scores** to measure learning progress.

###  3. Simulations (`simulations.py`)
-  Runs multiple training episodes (**default: 1000**).
-  Stores data on:
  -  **Total rewards per agent**
  -  **Capital growth trends**
  -  **Market share evolution**
-  Generates and saves **visualizations** in the `output/` directory.

##  Performance Results

###  1. Agent Performance Over Episodes
-  **Rewards start low (~200) but increase to ~450-500 per episode**, demonstrating successful learning.

###  2. Capital Growth Analysis
-  Both agents initially **experience capital loss** but **stabilize around episode 900**.

###  3. Market Share Distribution
-  Market share fluctuates but eventually **stabilizes near 100%**, requiring further analysis.

##  Next Steps for Improvement
 **Optimize reward functions** to prevent capital depletion.  
 **Enhance competitive behavior** to prevent unrealistic **100% market dominance**.  
 **Adjust Q-learning hyperparameters** for better decision-making efficiency.  

 **Evaluate the impact of different market conditions** to create a more dynamic training environment.  
 **Introduce adversarial strategies** to prevent agents from overfitting to specific conditions.
